  <b>A highly scalable and easily maintanable API built specially for next-insta application.</b> Technologies we are using to build this server are Express and TypeScript.</br>

## ❯ Why

Our main goal with this project is a feature complete server application. Mainly, we are focusing to sharpen our skills in Node.js, TypeScript, Docker, testing etc. We want to use every tool that allows us to perform a full development cycle, from coding the first dummy controller to deploying a ready-made, scalable application. We are also keen to absorb knowledge about good quality practices, design patterns and architecture enhancements. 

## ❯ Getting Started

In order to run this application, you need to setup your database. We use PostgreSQL. After you manage to do it, create an environment file and name it `.env.development`. Insert your environment variables basing on the environemnt file template. Now, install the dependencies and run the app!

```console
next-insta-api:$ yarn i && yarn dev
foo
```

## ❯ Getting Started
We use Swagger for documenting our endpoints. Hit the `/docs` endpoint to display the dashboard.
